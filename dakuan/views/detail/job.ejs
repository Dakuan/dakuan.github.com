			I work for <a href="http://www.thetechnologystudio.co.uk" title="my current employer" alt="mobile and web development"> The Technology Studio</a> which is a funky little development agency in Letchworth, Hertfordshire.
			It has a sister brand, <a href="http://www.earthware.co.uk" title="my current employer" alt="interactive mapping">Earthware</a>, which specialises in interactive mapping.

			I'm very happy where I am, so I'm not looking for new job. Unless you wish to pay me 1 x bazillion $$ to play with kittens.
