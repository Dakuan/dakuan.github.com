		<h2>Me</h2>
		<p>
			My name is Dom. Among other things I like to code. Luckily for me this is also my job. 
			It's not all I've ever done but it's the best balance of salubrity / financial reward / quality of office toys that I have found so far. 
		</p>
		<p>
			My other hobbies are reading (popular science / economics usually), cycling and curry. I live with rat x 1, cats x 3, fish x lots and wiminz x 1.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are lots of ways of getting hold of me, a few of which are detailed below. Email is best.
